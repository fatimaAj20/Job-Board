Welcome to our job board project! This application allows job seekers to search and apply for job postings, and for employers to post job listings and review applications. The project is built using the Laravel framework and utilizes a MySQL database for storing and retrieving data. This readme file provides information on how to install and set up the project, as well as how to use its various features. We hope you find this project useful and easy to use.
